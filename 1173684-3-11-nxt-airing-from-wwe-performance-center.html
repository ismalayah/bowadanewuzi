NXT will be taped from the WWE Performance Center in Orlando on March 11 due to the Full Sail studio not being available due to another event at the school.
At the time the conflict was reported, no new venue was announced. Jacob Cohen, who was at last night’s live taping at Full Sail, noted the PC would be the location for an NXT ‘Fan Appreciation Night’ and tickets would be first come, first serve."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s a funny thing, at this point it’s almost like a family relationship than it is strictly a business relationship. To be honest, at this point in time I can’t even tell you if we have a contractual obligation to it at this point, but we’re at the point where we just have conversations. ‘Hey, here’s what we’re going to do…’ and when this opportunity came up, we feel like being here is a strength.</p><p class=p1>It’s a learning experience for everybody. People forget that what happens here benefits all of WWE. Through our partnership with Full Sail, we’re not just training in-ring talent. We have producers and directors that are doing WrestleMania now and that level of stadium shows, that cut their teeth on that job here, and wouldn’t have had that opportunity otherwise,” Triple H noted.</p><p class=p1>The partnership goes so far beyond all of that, ‘we’re just renting out your live facility every Wednesday’ and we value that partnership at the highest of levels. I really mean that across the board. Full Sail is like family to us.”</p><p class=p1>Triple H later added that an announcement would follow, and confirmed the report that NXT would not be at Full Sail on March 11. Triple H said the school couldn’t change the commitment and they were OK with it, adding that WWE knew about it and it’s about what both sides need together and how they can support each other.</p><p>https://twitter.com/JJWilliamsWON/status/1232868547560431616</p><p>Read More:&nbsp;<a title="Triple H NXT TakeOver Portland Post-Show Media Call" href=#>Triple H NXT TakeOver Portland Post-Show Media Call</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBwam9wZGKAbn2QZqWxrF2WtrO1zaBkn6qfonq4w8Rmp56qlqS%2Frq3NnJxmm5Wjwaa%2B</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
