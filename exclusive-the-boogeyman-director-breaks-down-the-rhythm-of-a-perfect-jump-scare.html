Recommended Videos And the current bearer of that torch is The Boogeyman, the latest in a decades-long line of Stephen King screen adaptations, helmed by Host mastermind Rob Savage, who obviously knows a thing or two about eliciting cold sweats from his audiences given his prior projects."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And it’s the same thing. I was trying to mix it up in this movie, there are some jump scares that happen on one, and some jump scares that happen on 10. And it’s also just about making the whole movie feel unsafe as horror fans, the moments you can check your phone, or you can go make a cup of tea.”</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>He would go on to continue geeking about the “horror language” that so many fans of the genre are intimately familiar with, and factoring that particular brand of literacy into his directorial efforts.</p><p>“And so we tried… there’s a scene that takes place in the daytime, where a huge scare happens to get people off-guard. Daytime scenes are normally where the audience feels they can relax a little bit. So I love it when a horror movie knows that the audience understands the horror language, and then manages to still get them.”</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>There’s few more delightful indulgences on this planet than watching a top-notch creative mind lay out their process, and Savage’s firm grasp on his craft should be infinitely exciting to those looking forward to his future efforts. Indeed, if Savage and his contemporaries keep up this kind of pace, we almost might be able forgive the horror zeitgeist for birthing Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.</p><p data-characters=41 data-current-count=41 data-injectable=false>The Boogeyman is now playing in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonLGbnKrAqsLEZquhnV2XvLCzxLKkmqZdmbazscKtpqtlkqeyorfSZpuor55iwamxjKufsqyYonqwsoyaZKmdopuypMCMo6ymqF2osKK%2BxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
