Their task is to take down the members of the Justice League who have been brainwashed by the villain Brainiac. But, as it does take place in the DC universe, you might be wondering if the game takes place in the shared universe of the Batman: Arkham franchise. So, let’s look at the story of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and let you know if it is connected to any of Rocksteady’s previous games.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-is-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-part-of-the-batman-arkham-franchise data-injectable=false>Is Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League part of the Batman: Arkham franchise?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Today marks 7 years since the release of Batman: Arkham Knight. We're honored that so many players continue to keep Gotham safe after all these years, and can’t wait for you to explore the Arkhamverse's Metropolis in 2023. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Wz0yc1FCax</a></p>— Rocksteady Studios (@RocksteadyGames) <a href=#>June 23, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=811 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman</a> was revealed to be in the game, and it is the Batman: Arkham Batman we will be facing off against as the game does take place in that universe. In 2022, Rocksteady took to Twitter to celebrate the anniversary of Batman: Arkham Knight and they wrote that they “can’t wait for you to explore the Arkhamverse’s Metropolis.” Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League does take place in the Batman: Arkham universe, but the game will not spend much time in Gotham, instead taking place in Metropolis.</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>It is currently unknown how heavy the references to the previous games in the series would be, but Harley Quinn was a main character in those games so it would be weird if she did not mention her shared history with the Caped Crusader. Speaking of the Dark Knight Detective, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Conroy’s last performance of Batman</a> will be in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. The famed Batman voice actor passed away in November last year.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Because it is the Batman we controlled in the Batman: Arkham games, you have to wonder whether his secret identity being revealed at the end of Batman: Arkham Knight will play into Rocksteady’s new game at all. Let’s hope we don’t have to go up against him too much, as those boss fights will undoubtedly be some of the toughest ones gamers have ever faced.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=false>Check out Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League when it comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PC on May 26, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZooKxlo6q2pLXDnmSsqaWWsW63yKWjZqyYmnqrwdKtoJydXaGyorPUnmSpmaKperCyjK2fnmWRp7iprcyvnKurlWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
