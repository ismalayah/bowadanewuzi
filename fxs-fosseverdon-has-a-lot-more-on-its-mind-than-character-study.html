The person who created that dance and the person dancing would soon become husband and wife, but to call this meeting “love at first sight” is to bypass what makes it special. It pinpoints to the second the thunderclap of a realization shared between two people that they are in possession of a secret language all their own. But it shares a sense of inevitability, like watching a car crash in slow motion, with that earlier, considerably warmer and sexier sequence. It’s Verdon (Williams), overflowing with love and optimism, arriving at a Berlin hotel room door, behind which is Fosse (Rockwell), who’s about to break her heart.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/5cab68ffb8b50d0e04098684/content_fosse-verdon-2019.jpg><p><span class=s1></span>Those two scenes lay plain the two relationships, contained within one, which are the heart of “Fosse/Verdon.” When this limited series focuses on that relationship, it’s gripping, not least because Rockwell and Williams are remarkable performers doing unsurprisingly great work (Williams in particular is exemplary). And the series does, for the most part, keep its focus there, teasing out the messiness and conflict in the bond between two artists who bring out the best in each other—and in the case of Verdon, an artist whose significant behind-the-scenes contributions to Fosse’s body of work have been largely overlooked or undervalued. It’s also another story of a “troubled genius,” though refreshingly, “Fosse/Verdon” extends plenty of compassion to Bob Fosse without romanticizing either his trauma or his damaging behavior, and nearly as novelly, paints a portrait of Verdon that’s neither the saintly, long-suffering wife, nor the jealous, resentful shrew. She’s a human being, as is he, both creatures of complexity who managed to love each other, wound each other, and create great art all at once.</p><p><span class=s1>But “Fosse/Verdon” has a lot more on its mind than character study. In the five episodes provided to critics for review (three directed by Kail, one each by <a href=#>Adam Bernstein</a> and Jessica Yu), the series takes a lot of swings. Stylistically, it borrows from Fosse the director at times, embracing the rhythmic, sometimes psychologically-driven editing of “<a href=#>Cabaret</a>” and “All That Jazz” and the use of musical numbers as juxtaposition for what’s happening elsewhere in the story (sometimes even without the music, as when Verdon transports the gorilla head destined for “If You Could See Her” from “Cabaret” from New York to Germany in an act of pure love for a man others would tell her isn’t worthy of such affection and loyalty). It also recreates moments&nbsp;from films and stage musicals with a level of almost feverish detail. It sometimes make a point soundly, then builds to another chance to make that same point for the rest of the episode. And on top of that, it plays fast and loose with time, using even the title cards intended to root the audience in the correct time and place to place yet another narrative lens on the story, and that lens changes with some frequency as well: days ‘til death, days ‘til opening, days since an award win, number of awards won, and on, and on. It’s never simply “1973,” there’s always something more.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZp%2Bwo2KzsL%2FSnq2eqpSku260wKxkmmWcpMFuuc6rnGannmK2tb%2BMpqCnnF2ptaK6jJyfmqqRmMGmvoysq66cqQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
