In 2010, Congress debated the James Zadroga Health and Compensation Act, which included the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. According to <a href=#>CBS News</a>, that fund provides financial aid for serious medical issues to emergency workers who responded to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. Stewart addressed the issue on&nbsp;The Daily Show,&nbsp;and he's since become an advocate for members of that group, which have been beset by health problems — including more than "11,000 types of cancer."</p><p>One problem with the Victim Compensation Fund: Congress only authorized funding through the end of 2020. In June 2019, Stewart joined some 9/11 responders to urge reauthorization, testifying before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. Only about half of the committee's members reportedly showed up, which incensed Stewart. "I can't help but think what an incredible metaphor this room is," he said. "Behind me, a filled room of 9/11 first responders, and in front of me, a nearly empty Congress. Sick and dying, they brought themselves down here to speak to no one." He spoke through tears and anger, and received a standing ovation from observers.</p><p>The next day, the subcommittee <a href=#>unanimously approved</a> a bill to continue funding the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. At the time of this writing, that legislation was making its way <a href=#>through the system</a> on Capitol Hill.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam1lbn9ye9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5yailZqukmsSivtNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
