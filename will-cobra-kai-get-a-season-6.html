At the time of writing, however, a sixth run has yet to be officially greenlit. However, we have received an encouraging update from a very reliable source.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is season six a sure thing?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Cobra-Kai-season-five.jpg><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>Again, while Cobra Kai season six hasn’t been announced so far, it looks like we can safely say it’s going to happen. Back in July, EP Jon Hurwitz — who is part of CK‘s triumvirate of showrunners, alongside Hayden Schlossberg and Josh Heald — was asked on Twitter if the series is now “close to the end” and if there are “many more years” still to come.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Hurwitz was careful not to get too specific in his response, but his comments should cause Cobra Kai diehards to sigh with relief. “All I can say is that we can expect more Cobra Kai to come and that the Miyagiverse is far from finished,” he wrote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>All I can say is that we expect more Cobra Kai to come and that the Miyagiverse is far from finished. <a href=#>#CobraKai</a> <a href=#>#Netflix</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/QdXETsOd21</a></p>— Jon Hurwitz (@jonhurwitz) <a href=#>July 16, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>According to what Hurwitz has to say, then, fans don’t need to worry as it seems like the creators don’t have any plans to call it a day with Cobra Kai just yet.</p><h2 id=h-so-what-s-next-for-the-miyagiverse data-injectable=false>So what’s next for the Miyagiverse?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Daniel-LaRusso-Cobra-Kai.jpg><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false>This begs the question, then: what’s next for the Miyagiverse?</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>Well, for starters, there are certain things Cobra Kai has yet to tick off its to-do list. While Karate Kid Part III star Sean Kanan is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">set to return as Mike Barnes</a> in season five, there are still a few key players from the films that have yet to reappear in the franchise. Most notable is Hilary Swank, who starred as Julie Pierce in The Next Karate Kid. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The creators have maintained</a> that they would love to have Swank on their show, so it’s easy to imagine Julie featuring in a sixth season.</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Hurwitz’s use of the term “Miyagiverse” specifically also brings to mind the possibility of the franchise being expanded. Well, this isn’t the first time he’s teased such a thing as Hurwitz likewise revealed on Twitter — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">back in September 2021</a> — that “various” ideas for spinoff projects were being discussed. It’s unclear how those talks are going a year later, but with any luck at least one concept has been further developed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cobra-kai-s5-10-scaled.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cobra-kai-s5-9-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cobra-kai-s5-8-scaled.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cobra-kai-s5-7-scaled.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cobra-kai-s5-6-scaled-e1663622823430.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cobra-kai-s5-5-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cobra-kai-s5-4-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cobra-kai-s5-3-scaled.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cobra-kai-s5-2-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cobra-kai-s5-1-scaled-e1661972232931.jpg><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>It’s worth mentioning, though, that Hurwitz, Schlossberg, and Heald are extremely busy these days. In addition to continuing Cobra Kai, the trio are working on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Duke Nukem movie</a> — based on the video game franchise — for Legendary Entertainment. Not to mention they’ll be giving another iconic ’80s movie the Cobra Kai treatment too — they’re creating <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Ferris Bueller’s Day Off spinoff</a> for Paramount.</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>In other words, any additional Miyagiverse projects may be a ways to go, but the odds are looking good that we can expect Cobra Kai season six sometime in 2023. And, if we’re really lucky, maybe we’ll even get a seventh season a year after that. The future of Miyagi-Do, Eagle Fang, and of course, Cobra Kai should become much clearer once season five arrives on Sept. 9 and no doubt provides yet another big viewership win for Netflix.</p><p data-characters=22 data-current-count=22 data-injectable=false>Cobra Kai never dies!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tculZJynkqeubrfAomSgnaRirm6%2FxJqqqKZda3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
