User @conquerorcomics went viral for sharing their love of Anson Mount’s performance as Black Bolt in 2022’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. The Star Trek; Strange New Worlds icon made quite the impression on viewers despite not uttering a line of dialogue and swiftly being killed off by Scarlet Witch.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>“Anson Mount’s performance in this single shot alone was better than anything Zachary Levi ever did as Shazam,” went their claim. A cruel comparison? Shazam loyalists might say so, but the almost-two thousands likes the tweet has accrued suggests t’s one many agree with.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anson Mount’s performance in this single shot alone was better than anything Zachary Levi ever did as Shazam <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OXVfkUdcoN</a></p>— Block A ♦️ (@conquercomics) <a href=#>April 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=593 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>Comparing Shazam and Black Bolt might seem rather random, but actually the pair make an interesting case study as the characters have had the exact opposite arcs in terms of public opinion. 2019’s Shazam! was universally praised, only for Fury of the Gods <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to retroactively make it one of DC’s least popular franchises</a>, Mount’s Blackagar Boltagan was initially nothing more than the lead of ABC’s infamously awful Inhumans TV series, but his Doctor Strange 2 opened him up to a whole new audience of fans. Now folks would love to see him return to his role a third time.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>Levi’s future in the rebooted DCU, meanwhile, remains to be seen, although perhaps the star’s friendship with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bosses James Gunn and Peter Safran</a> might help his chances.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJosZqbmJa%2FunnLnq2iZZykwKa%2FjJqemqGeYq60ecyaqa%2BdnGKzorrSZpuem5yWv6Z506GcZqWTqsBuv8eoqa2do6l6rbXVnptmq6WlsrO0xKumZqulpbKztc6rZK2nXai1osbApmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
