None of us are going to look 25 again and who would want to? I wouldn’t.’</p><p>Kensit discussed how she maintained a healthy lifestyle and revealed she took up meditation following a trip she made to Thailand.</p><p>She said: ‘I went to Chiva-Som to do some meditation and that changed my life completely. I practice Yoga Nidra, which is a guided meditation. It makes me feel so much better.</p><p>‘Yoga has never worked for me, I’ve never been able to do the downward dog. I like light weights and running.</p><p>‘What I put in my body I find very important. I don’t diet, I just eat clean, fresh and healthy, not processed, foods.’</p><p>She added: ‘It’s important to take the time for yourself, look in the mirror and love yourself. Be the best you can be for the age that you are at.’</p><p>Kensit, who sang with the band Eighth Wonder in the 1980s, has been married and divorced four times.</p><p>She has two sons, 26-year-old James with Simple Minds musician Jim Kerr and 18-year-old Lennon with former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher.</p><p>The actress said that her role as a mother inspired her to get through the “ups and downs” she had experience in her life.</p><p>She said: ‘I went through a lot over the years. That can make you never want to leave your house. What kind of mother would I have been if I didn’t come out of the duvet for a week?</p><p>‘The kids have always lived with me. I had to work, I had to make a living. But I’m 50 now, I don’t really care what people say.’</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=patsy-kensit-%e2%80%93-video></span><span>Patsy Kensit – Video</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fpa61v9hmop6mo57Bbq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6txp5knZmUYrW2v8GapZ2rXai9sMHSnmScoJmhsbOxzWalnqxdrLyzwMdmqqiml6h6rrvVopysZZGjsW7A1WaqoaenqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
