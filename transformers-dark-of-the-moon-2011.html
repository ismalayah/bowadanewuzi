These include Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), who earlier saved the world but now has a job in a mail room, and Carly (<a href=#>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</a>), who is his sexy girlfriend because the movie requires a sexy girlfriend. There are also such characters as Mearing (<a href=#>Frances McDormand</a>), a government official; Bruce Brazos (<a href=#>John Malkovich</a>), Sam's anal-retentive boss; Carly's former boyfriend Dylan (<a href=#>Patrick Dempsey</a>), whose classic car collection upstages every robot in the movie; the FBI manipulator Simmons (<a href=#>John Turturro</a>) ; the peculiar Jerry Wang (<a href=#>Ken Jeong</a>), and the expert warriors Lennox (<a href=#>Josh Duhamel</a>) and Epps (<a href=#>Tyrese Gibson</a>). If you pause to consider for a second, not one of these characters is actually required in the conflict, which is, after all, pretty much between the bots.</p><p>Oh, but the humans are needed for us. They are required because bots have no personalities and little intrinsic interest apart from the banging noises they make. They speak in dubbed English that sounds oddly separate from the other voices in the film. And they are so many times larger than the humans that I was reminded of the scale used in "The Incredible Shrinking Man." We also need people because I, for one, will never care for Optimus Prime any more than for an engine block.</p><p>There is no style or wit in the dialogue, except when Malkovich adds his own spin. This is one of those annoying pictures where disembodied voices are heard during chaotic action: <i>Class dismissed! Decepticon punk! We've got a Mexican Standoff here! What do you think you're doing! Return what belongs to me!</i></p><p>Shia LaBeouf is scarcely heroic, and his girlfriend has no particular function except to be in constant peril and (in two hilarious shots) stare thoughtfully into space as if realizing something. The only considerable dramatic scene LaBeouf has is when his mother (<a href=#>Julie White</a>) brings the manic plot to a standstill long enough to urge a self-help book upon her son.</p><p>I hesitate to mention another problem with the film, because in all fairness it may not be Bay's fault. The framing looks wrong. When you look at enough movies, you develop a sixth sense for what feels correct within the frame. This film seemed too close to its compositions. There was a paucity of head room, feet were nearly cut off, the sides seemed to squeeze. This wasn't dramatic, but I could feel it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tqZqmo5u8s7nEq6pmnJGnuG67xWaroZ1dorywuoxrZ2pp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
