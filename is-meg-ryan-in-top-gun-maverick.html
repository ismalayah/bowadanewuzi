Carole was the wife of naval flight officer Nick Bradshaw and the mother to Bradley Bradshaw. Actor Anthony Edwards portrayed Nick.

This was because Ryan had stepped away from the entertainment industry in 2016 and didn’t reprise her role. Ryan made this decision after her son Jack Quaid, whom she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shares with ex-husband Dennis Quaid,</a> graduated from high school. It is reported that Ryan decided to leave because she was overworked and burnt out. The 61-year-old has since moved to New York City.
