And they do.

The idea of the Dennehy's illegal boxing arena is a storytelling masterstroke; it explains the small crowds at the same time it permits the boxers to fight dirty.</p><p>And they do. Hitting below the belt is just a warm-up for these violent street brawlers, who also kick their opponent's jaws, rub harmful substances in their eyes, and keep punching opponents who are already unconscious. Tommy, a talented Golden Gloves amateur, is repelled by the dangerous level of violence encouraged in the illegal ring, but Dennehy buys up his father's gambling debts and makes other threats to keep him fighting. He knows what buttons to push.</p><p>James Marshall, as Tommy, is a member of the <a href=#>River Phoenix</a> school of studied detachment. He is so aloof, indeed, that at times he seems like a neutral observer of his own life. I can see what he's trying to do, and sometimes it works, but he pushes his cool too far.</p><p>The film places its boxing story in a surprisingly realistic milieu; when he isn't dealing out punishment, Riley goes to high school, discusses <a href=#>Mark Twain</a>, is encouraged by a helpful teacher, finds a girlfriend and becomes pals with a local black fighter (Cuba Gooding Jr., from "<a href=#>Boyz N the Hood</a>"). The movie was co-produced by Frank Price, who produced "Boyz," and it exhibits nimble footwork in avoiding the cliche of a black-white showdown in the final fight; Dennehy himself climbs into the ring with Marshall, so at last the hero of a fight film is boxing his real opponent.</p><p>"<a href=#>Gladiator</a>" was directed by <a href=#>Rowdy Herrington</a>, a filmmaker with a natural feel for pumped-up action. His credits include the stalker film "<a href=#>Jack's Back</a>" and the ludicrous but not unentertaining "<a href=#>Road House</a>," which was about the toughest bouncers in the world.</p><p>What he has here is a story that probably cannot be believed in any conceivable level, and yet, to give him his due, he tells it with such conviction that it works anyway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46go5qcmZbBsL6ManByal1mhnp%2B</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
