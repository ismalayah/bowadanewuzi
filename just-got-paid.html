Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴Yeah
Oh, yeah Ooh, yeah
Feels good, feels good
OhJust got paid, it's Friday night
Party huntin', feelin' right Body shakin', all around (body shakin' all around)
Know one thing (I'm gonna be) I'm gettin' downCheck the mirror, I'm lookin' fly
Round up your posse, jump in my ride
Radio rockin', a monster jam
Feel the rhythm, pump up the sound"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The lyrics describe a person who has just been paid and is in high spirits, ready to party and have a good time. The excitement of the weekend is palpable as the person gets ready to hit the town, and their confidence grows as they look in the mirror and prepare to meet up with their friends. The rhythm of the music and the energy of the lyrics perfectly capture the essence of Friday night revelry and the joy of letting loose after a long week of work.</p><br><p>The lyrics continue to focus on the person's excitement as they arrive at the party and begin to dance to the music. They feel empowered and confident as they move to the beat, and they are captivated by the sight of an attractive woman who is also dancing. The lyrics build to a crescendo as the person's excitement and enthusiasm reach new heights, and they encourage the woman to come closer and dance with them. The song ends with a repetition of the chorus and a quick guitar riff that perfectly captures the energy and excitement of the track.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Just got paid, it's Friday night</u><br>I just received my paycheck and it's Friday, so I'm ready to go out and have fun</p><br><p><u>Party huntin', feelin' right</u><br>Looking for a good party to attend tonight and feeling excited</p><br><p><u>Body shakin', all around (body shakin' all around)</u><br>My body is moving to the beat of the music and I'm having a great time</p><br><p><u>Know one thing (I'm gonna be) I'm gettin' down</u><br>The only thing I know for sure is that I'll be dancing and having a good time</p><br><p><u>Check the mirror, I'm lookin' fly</u><br>I'm checking my appearance in the mirror and feeling confident and attractive</p><br><p><u>Round up your posse, jump in my ride</u><br>Gather your friends and get in my car so we can go to the party together</p><br><p><u>Radio rockin', a monster jam</u><br>The radio is playing an awesome song that's getting me pumped up for the party</p><br><p><u>Feel the rhythm, pump up the sound</u><br>I'm really feeling the music and turning up the volume to get into the groove</p><br><p><u>I'm feelin' so good</u><br>I'm in a really good mood</p><br><p><u>Don't you know I'm just groovin' to the beat?</u><br>I'm dancing to the rhythm of the music and having a great time</p><br><p><u>Just got paid (just got paid) Friday night (Friday)</u><br>Repeating the idea of receiving my paycheck on a Friday night</p><br><p><u>Party huntin', (party huntin') the bass is right (feelin' alright)</u><br>Looking for a good party where the music is hot and the atmosphere is fun</p><br><p><u>Booty shakin', all around (all around baby)</u><br>Dancing and moving my body to the music</p><br><p><u>Poured one drink, now I'm gettin' down</u><br>Drinking a little bit and feeling more relaxed, ready to dance even more</p><br><p><u>On the floor, rockin' to the beat</u><br>Dancing on the floor and matching my moves to the rhythm of the music</p><br><p><u>Ooh-wee, you sure look sweet</u><br>Expressing my appreciation for the attractiveness of someone nearby</p><br><p><u>Fine young lady standin' by</u><br>There is an attractive girl nearby</p><br><p><u>Come on baby, sweet eye delight</u><br>Inviting the girl to dance with me and acknowledging her beauty</p><br><p><u>Come here girl</u><br>Asking the girl to come closer and dance with me</p><br><p><u>You look so sweet when you're movin' to the beat</u><br>Complimenting the girl's dancing and expressing my attraction to her</p><br><p><u>I'm tired of all these boring parties</u><br>Expressing dissatisfaction with past parties and hoping that this one is more fun</p><br><p><u>Why don't we get on down?</u><br>Suggesting that we dance and have a good time</p><br><p><u>Money in my pocket</u><br>Feeling financially secure and able to afford to have a good time</p><br><p><u>Show you a good time</u><br>Promising to make sure that the people around me have a good time and enjoy themselves</p><br><p><u>Gettin' down</u><br>Continuing to dance and have a good time</p><br><p><u>Say ho</u><br>Making an exclamation of excitement and energy</p><br><p><u>Gettin' gettin' gettin' down</u><br>Emphasizing that I'm really getting into the groove and having a good time dancing</p><br><p><u>Tell me where to party is</u><br>Asking for suggestions on where to find a good party</p><br><p><u>Come on</u><br>Encouraging someone to join me in dancing and having a good time</p><br><p><u>Uh</u><br>Expressing a moment of excitement and enthusiasm</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © BMG Rights Management, Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC<br>Written by: Gene Griffin, Aaron Robin Hall, Johnny Kemp, Teddy Riley</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIKfnbuvxb6EnKaoX5%2FCtMC%2BoKatl6CWtqU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
