And not just any jewelry store, but find out for yourself. He has it all mapped out as a victimless crime: They won't use guns, they'll hit early Saturday when the shopping mall doesn't have customers, the store's losses will be covered by insurance, and so on. Sounds good on paper, before everything goes wrong. And that's when the movie becomes intense and emotionally devastating.</p><p>These two brothers are capable of feeling emotions rare in modern crime films: grief and remorse. They cave in with regret. And they <i>still</i> need money; Andy learns that when you are heartbroken it is bad enough, but even worse when your legs may be broken, too. Meanwhile, their dozy father (<a href=#>Albert Finney</a>) starts looking into the case himself, and that leads to a conversation with one son that <a href=#>Eugene O'Neill</a> couldn't have written any better.</p><p>The movie fully establishes the families involved. Finney has been married forever to <a href=#>Rosemary Harris</a>, and still loves her to pieces. Hoffman is married to <a href=#>Marisa Tomei</a>, who just keeps on getting sexier as she grows older so very slowly. Hawke is divorced from <a href=#>Amy Ryan</a>, who would happily see him in jail for non-payment of child support. Although the film opens with Hoffman and Tomei ecstatically making love in Rio (say what you will about the big guy, Hoffman looks to be an energetic and capable lover), their marriage is far from perfect.</p><p>The Japanese name some of their artists Living Treasures. Sidney Lumet is one of ours. He has made more great pictures than most directors have made pictures, and found time to make some clunkers on the side. Here he takes a story that is, after all, pretty straightforward, and tells it in an ingenious style we might call <i>narrative interruptus. </i>The brilliant debut screenplay by <a href=#>Kelly Masterson</a> takes us up to a certain point, then flashes back to before that point, then catches us up again, then doubles back, so that it meticulously reconstructs how spectacularly and inevitably this perfect crime went wrong.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bnJ%2Bnopp6tbTEZpuerpmheqy6zrCqZrGfqr%2BmecOemJ1lYmV9eA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
