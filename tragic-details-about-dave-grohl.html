"The first time we had a beer together, we were like, 'We're gonna be best friends for the rest of our lives,'" Grohl once shared with&nbsp;<a href=# aria-describedby=external-disclaimer title="(opens new window)">Radio X</a>. "And it's true, really." After Hawkins experienced a heroin overdose in 2001 that left him in a weeks-long coma, Grohl told <a href=#>The Guardian</a> that he was ready to step away from music once and for all.&nbsp;As he explained to the outlet, "Because, to me, it felt like music equalled death." Hawkins stopped using after the overdose, telling&nbsp;Kerrang (via <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>) that he'd taken up hobbies like mountain biking.</p><p dir=ltr>Following Hawkins' death, the Foo Fighters announced on <a href=#>Instagram</a> that the rest of their tour dates had been cancelled. The band wrote, "Let's take this time to grieve, to heal, to pull our loved ones close, and to appreciate all the music and memories we've made together."</p><p>If you or anyone you know is struggling with addiction issues, help is available.
