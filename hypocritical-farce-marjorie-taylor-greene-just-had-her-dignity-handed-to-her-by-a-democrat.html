On Jan. 30, the House voted on whether to bring two articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Presumably because this week saw another vote on Mayorkas held, which on this occasion passed, Taylor Greene‚Äôs confusing contribution to the hearing is being enjoyed all over again.</p><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>The viral video depicts Taylor Greene being as eloquent as ever, as she spewed out a statement that‚Äôs about three-quarters of the way to making some semblance of coherent sense. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk about border patrol apprehensions between ports of entry at the Southwest border of terrorists,‚Äù was the line she mangled, despite having the words literally written out in front of her, sounding eerily like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ChatGPT during its existential meltdown</a> in the process. Isn‚Äôt it wonderful when bad things happen to bad sentences?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Call the fire dept.

Seth Magaziner wasted no time in capitalizing on the moment to put Taylor Greene to task. Neatly skipping over her garbled diction, proving he‚Äôs a better man than me, Magaziner responded:</p><p>‚ÄúI have to say, it is pretty rich hearing the gentlewoman from Georgia express her concern about terrorism when she literally was selling defund the FBI T-shirts and hats on her website for $30 apiece. $30 for the shirts and another $30 for the hats ‚Äì you don‚Äôt get both for just the $30 ‚Äì the leading law enforcement agency tasked with combating terrorism in this country and keeping people safe, and she wants to defund it,‚Äù he explained before concluding, ‚ÄúSo I am not going to take any lectures from her on securing this homeland from terror.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>Yes, Magaziner knows what he‚Äôs talking about, and here‚Äôs the receipts. These fetching garments can be yours for the steal of a price of $30 each! For the full Marjorie Taylor Greene experience, why not wear them while you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">come after Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, discuss <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">your expertise on men‚Äôs bathrooms</a>, and generally prove that you have a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">startling lack of empathy for the rest of humanity</a>.
