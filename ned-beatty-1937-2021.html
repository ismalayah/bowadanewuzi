He climbed the ladder up to the theater scene in Louisville in the ‘60s before making his film debut in 1972 in a little film called “<a href=#>Deliverance</a>.” The <a href=#>Jon Voight</a> & <a href=#>Burt Reynolds</a> thriller became a massive hit, shocking audiences all the way to three Oscar nominations.</p><p>Beatty used “Deliverance” as a springboard to constant work in the ‘70s on film and TV, starring in projects like “The Last American Hero,” “White Lightning,” and even a two-part episode of “The Rockford Files.” His next major project came in 1975 when Beatty appeared in <a href=#>Robert Altman</a>’s “<a href=#>Nashville</a>” as Del Reese, the local organizer for Hal Phillip Walker, a man who wants to be president. That project was quickly followed by arguably his best work of that era in “<a href=#>Network</a>,” the only performance that would land Beatty an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. So much of <a href=#>Sidney Lumet</a>’s drama feels like it reflects media culture but Beatty’s cynical chairman of the board may have been the most ahead of his time. It’s a shrewd, clever performance in a film, one of those turns that feels like it couldn’t have been given by anyone else. &nbsp;</p><p>The credits from there on out are simply remarkable over the next few years, including “All the President’s Men,” “Silver Streak,” and “Mikey and Nicky,” before he took his place in superhero history by co-starring alongside <a href=#>Gene Hackman</a>’s Lex Luthor as the supervillain’s henchman Otis in “Superman: The Movie.” Perhaps it was the quirkiness of that role that did it, but Beatty largely played funny scene-stealers in the ‘80s, popping up in “1941,” “<a href=#>Hopscotch</a>,” “<a href=#>The Incredible Shrinking Woman</a>,” “The Toy,” “<a href=#>Stroker Ace</a>,” “<a href=#>Back to School</a>,” and “<a href=#>The Big Easy</a>,” just to name a few. In 1988, he starred in “<a href=#>Switching Channels</a>,” marking the fifth time he worked with his buddy Burt Reynolds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmraqZl8K1sdJopZ6cXZeyosDTsmRqcWNsenN8kWo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
