If you haven’t seen Shippuden completely, or have just forgotten after binging the hundreds of episodes that follow, you may have forgotten by whose hand Orochimaru is slain.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Who kills Orochimaru?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sasuke-vs-Orochimaru-1.jpg><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>Orochimaru is killed by Sasuke Uchiha during Episode 114 of Naruto Shippuden, “Eye of the Hawk.” His death, however, is not so simple.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>During the episode, Sasuke comes to slay Orochimaru before he attempts to take over the young Uchiha’s body. During their confrontation, the Legendary Sanin attempts the transfer ceremony; however, Sasuke is too powerful and resists the Jutsu and seemingly kills Orochimaru to end the fight.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>While his body was destroyed, Orochimaru wasn’t completely killed off in this fight, but rather was instead sealed within the curse mark. During Sasuke’s fight with Itachi, due to his exhaustion and lack of chakra, Orochimaru emerges once again but is quickly sealed away by Itachi’s Susanoo’s Toska Blade.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=false>Later, Orochimaru is revived completely by Sasuke using some of Kabuto’s DNA along with Anko’s cursed mark to activate the Evil Releasing Jutsu. After returning through this Jutsu, Orochimaru has remained alive and can be seen in <strong>Naruto‘s</strong> follow-up, Boruto.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn6hlm565rb%2BMqKmom5ieuqK%2B1Gagp2Welr%2B2wM5o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
