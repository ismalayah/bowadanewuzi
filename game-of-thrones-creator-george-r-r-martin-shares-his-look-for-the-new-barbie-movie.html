Through the film, Gerwig successfully challenged the patriarchal undertones that, until now, dictated the association of color almost exclusively with femininity. With a majority of viewers, males, and females alike, turning up to watch the movie in pink, we can say Gerwig has done an excellent job in reinforcing and popularizing gender neutrality around color.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>While many users’ replies to Martin’s tweet and picture echoed a similar sentiment, there are a few others who, after seeing their favorite author dressed in the best-suited attire for the movie, were reminded of the author’s own contribution to the fantasy world.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>One of which includes the unfinished book series of A Song of Ice and Fire. Despite the two major television adaptations, Martin’s inability to complete the series earned him the title of “definitely low kenergy” from a user while others questioned if he would ever finish the series anytime soon.</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=116 data-injectable=false>All that aside, Martin’s tweet is the talk of the town now and is inspiring even more love for Gerwig’s classic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S0ornEZqafZaSdv7C6xKxknKqVlsGwvoygnKiql5p6s3nRZqSaqqSeu26%2Fx5qpnqtdnba0ecuopqRllqS%2FbsDHnmSnnadir6K%2BwaKcZqWfq7amew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
