The yearly American football game tends to be one of the highest-viewed events on television, with an estimated 208 million people watching in 2022, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NFL</a>. This year’s game is expected to do the same as football fans all over the world turn out to see whether the Kansas City Chiefs or the Philadelphia Eagles take home the Vince Lombardi Trophy. From hilarious commercials to sneak peeks at some of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most anticipated movies and TV shows</a> of the year, the Super Bowl is more than just a game — it’s the cultural event of the season. And let’s not forget the halftime show — this year the stage will be graced by none other than a worldwide superstar, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rihanna</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Ever since the rise of streaming platforms, an increasing trend, especially amongst Millenials and Gen-Z NFL fans, is not wanting to pay for cable. People still want to be part of the Super Bowl action, though. Here is how those who do not have cable can stream and watch the big game for free.</p><h2 id=h-here-is-how-to-stream-super-bowl-lvii-in-2023 data-injectable=false>Here is how to stream Super Bowl LVII in 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sup-2.jpeg><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>This year’s Super Bowl LVII will be broadcasted by Fox. Those lucky few who have cable or satellite and wish to stream the game on their smart device can do so through the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox Sports website</a> or mobile app by signing in with your cable provider. You can also stream the game through the NFL mobile app but this requires a subscription to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NFL Plus</a>. Both the Fox Sports and NFL mobile apps are available on all iPhones and Androids as well as AppleTV, FireTV, AndroidTV, Roku, and Google Chromecast.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>For those who don’t have cable or satellite, fret not — you can still stream the game live via Hulu Plus, Sling TV, YouTube TV, and fuboTV. A paid subscription is required for each platform. That said, some of them offer free trials — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hulu Plus</a> offers a one-month free trial; <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fuboTV</a> offers a 7-day free trial; and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube TV</a> offers a 14-day free trial.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sling TV</a> does not offer a free trial. Instead, it offers half off your first month. A subscription to the Blue tier is required to stream Fox. For those who plan to sign up for a free trial to the aforementioned platforms, it’s best to get your ducks in a row ahead of time to ensure nothing goes awry at the last minute.</p><h2 id=h-when-is-super-bowl-lvii data-injectable=false>When is Super Bowl LVII?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sup-3.jpeg><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>Super Bowl LVII will take place on February 12th, 2023. The new standard for the NFL is that the Super Bowl will take place on the second Sunday in February, as opposed to the first as it used to be. Super Bowl LVII will be kick off at 6:30 p.m. PST and 3:30 p.m. PST.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>Super Bowl LVII will take place in Glendale, Arizona, the home of the Arizona Cardinals. This breaks back-to-back years that the host stadium had its own team play in the Super Bowl. In 2022, the Los Angeles Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. In 2021, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers took down the Kansas City Chiefs at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay. Unfortunately, the Arizona Cardinals did not qualify for the playoffs this NFL season.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>For those NFL fans who are looking forward to Super Bowl LVII, there is still time to get ready and watch the big game on February 12th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpbyzwNJon6ivXam8bsPArZqhZaSdsm6%2F1Kmcq2WSpMSteZFpaWxln6N6tMDRnpimoZ6ceqK6w2amp6SZo7Juw8itn6itpGKwoq7LnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
