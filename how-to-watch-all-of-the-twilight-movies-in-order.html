Decked out in their best Team Jacob or Team Edward get-ups, there was something special about being in a theater surrounded by other fans who understood the story inside and out.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>While the theater was a fantastic place to watch the movies, would-be Cullens have also taken to hosting movie nights for friends and once-a-month binge-a-thons for themselves — because, let’s face it, we’ve never been able to let go of our desire to become a Cullen ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>So, just how can you dive right into a&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;watch party of your own?

It begins with the moment we see Bella as she gazes upon Edward for the first time; we see the time he perfectly catches the apple she drops at lunch, we watch Bella as she interacts with the Cullen family for the first time, and we also witness the painful and evil side of the coin in the vampires who don’t survive off of a “vegetarian lifestyle.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=68 data-injectable=false>The official synopsis for&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;reads as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>High-school student Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), always a bit of a misfit, doesn’t expect life to change much when she moves from sunny Arizona to rainy Washington state. Then she meets Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a handsome but mysterious teen whose eyes seem to peer directly into her soul. Edward is a vampire whose family does not drink blood, and Bella, far from being frightened, enters into a dangerous romance with her immortal soulmate.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Dangerous romance, forbidden fruit, and a lion and lamb who fall in love — a Shakespearean bond, a love story for the ages;&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;has it all. You can begin your watch-a-thon now on Paramount Plus.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Next in line is&nbsp;New Moon, which sees a more emotionally-charged storyline, and one with a lot of pain and heartache. Edward leaves Bella behind in an attempt to keep her safe from harm, sending her into a downward spiral. She sits for months waiting for him to come back before realizing that putting herself in harm’s way allows her to have visions of him, and something is better than nothing where Edward is concerned.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Bella begins acting out and scaring everyone around her, and as she grows closer to Jacob, something else happens within her. She transforms in New Moon, as does someone very close to her. These changes spur quite the transformation in Bella’s life and the lives of everyone around her.</p><p data-characters=62 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>The official synopsis for&nbsp;New Moon&nbsp;reads as follows:</p><p>Bella Swan is on the cusp of her 18th birthday and blissfully happy with her undead beau Edward Cullen. While celebrating her birthday with Edward’s family of `vegetarian’ vampires, a frightening incident convinces Edward that he’s simply too dangerous to be around his sweetheart. He decides to leave the town of Forks in order to ensure her safety – leaving her behind, angry and depressed.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>What happens next is an adventure for everyone involved, and it kicks off the following chapters in the epic love story between Edward and Bella and the blending of worlds. Like its predecessor,&nbsp;New Moon is also available on Paramount Plus.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Things truly heat up in&nbsp;Eclipse&nbsp;when Bella is forced to make the final decision: where does her heart belong, what life will she choose, and who will she commit herself to become? All of those questions are answered throughout the tumultuous journey being told in the third installment of the&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;Saga, and it’s quite an exciting journey.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>The official synopsis for&nbsp;Eclipse&nbsp;reads as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>Danger again surrounds Bella (Kristen Stewart) as a string of mysterious killings terrorizes Seattle, and a malicious vampire continues her infernal quest for revenge. Amid the tumult, Bella must choose between her love for Edward (Robert Pattinson) and her friendship with Jacob (Taylor Lautner), knowing that her decision may ignite the long-simmering feud between vampire and werewolf.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>Of course, it’s not just love that’s on the line and the decisions of Bella Swan — as the synopsis promises, the choices everyone makes could mean life or death for the once tame existence between supernatural beings in Forks. Any step too far in one direction could cause set it all on fire, and Forks isn’t a place that welcomes fire.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=81 data-injectable=false>After you watch Twilight and New Moon, you can stream Eclipse on Paramount Plus.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 (2011)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>The epic love story between human and vampire continues in&nbsp;Breaking Dawn,&nbsp;and the book was so captivating that the film had to be split into two parts. There was just too much going on to condense it into one movie, and the decision couldn’t have been better.</p><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>Part one saw Bella and Edward’s wedding, honeymoon, and the beginning of an event that no one could have anticipated. With a beautiful ceremony under their belts and a sultry post-wedding celebration, Bella quickly finds out that she’s pregnant, and things are happing at a speed that makes no sense. It’s enough to throw off everyone around them, including Jacob and the wolves — the baby between Bella and Edward could change everything for everyone, but Bella doesn’t care. She’s set on having the baby even if it kills her — and it just might.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>Of course, book readers knew that Bella made it out alive, but it was still an emotionally charged experience to see her as she grew more willing to sacrifice herself each day.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>The synopsis for Breaking Dawn Part 1 & 2 reads as follows:</p><p>At last, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are getting married. When Jacob (Taylor Lautner) finds out that Bella wants to spend her honeymoon as a human, he is horrified — for Edward’s passion could accidentally kill her. Bella does indeed survive her honeymoon, but a new complication arises when she discovers that she’s pregnant — and the child is growing at an alarming rate. The pregnancy sets the wolves against Bella and Edward, but Jacob vows to protect his friend.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>With battle lines drawn and hope on the horizon,&nbsp;Breaking Dawn Part 2&nbsp;was just as emotional an experience.&nbsp;You can continue your Twilight binge by tuning into Breaking Dawn Part 1 on Paramount Plus.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 (2012)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>The final film in The Twilight Saga is Breaking Dawn – Part 2, and it’s the perfect conclusion to the epic love story we still can’t get enough of. For their entire lives, the Cullens have been running — or perhaps, checking out swiftly in the night — never getting too close or too comfortable. The grand finale saw a different side of the story, where they decided to stop running and ask for help.</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>After the birth of Bella and Edward’s daughter, a special search was started to see if there were other vampiric children or offspring born of both humans and vampires, and the Cullens were greeted by those who didn’t judge but wanted to understand their situation instead. They found that instead of hiding and pushing everyone away, they could open up and ask for help, and when push came to shove, they didn’t have to fight alone.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Of course, Renesmee was different than most, and it was her own essence that finally got the fighting to stop, and the Cullens were allowed to live a life that suited them. Bella and Edward didn’t have to live in fear, and a special bond between Renesmee and Jacob further promised they’d all live a long life together. The last installment in the film franchise was special, powerful, and all-encompassing.</p><p data-characters=53 data-current-count=53 data-injectable=false>Breaking Dawn Part 2 is streaming on Paramount Plus.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=false>If you’re looking to have a Twilight movie marathon, make sure you’re subscribed to Paramount Plus, and don’t forget that with the promise of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">television series on the horizon</a>, now is also the perfect time to dive deep into the books that started it all.
