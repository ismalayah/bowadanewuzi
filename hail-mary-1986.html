Her father runs a service station. Her boyfriend, Joseph, drives a taxi. An angel arrives by jet plane, is taken to the service station in Joseph's taxi and tells Mary that she will soon bear God's child.</p><p>In the film, much is made of Mary's puzzlement over this announcement. When she discovers that she is pregnant, she insists to her parents, Joseph and her gynecologist that she is a virgin - something that her doctor confirms. Although her visit to the gynecologist has been described as particularly offensive, I didn't find it so. It serves as a reminder that this woman was not only the mother of Christ, but also, in every respect, a human being with apprehensions and fears. A central fact of Catholicism is that God became man, but when we sentimentalize the figure of Mary into a bloodless, asexual abstraction, we diminish the meaning of that fact.</p><p>The film is resolute in placing Mary's situation in a modern-day frame of reference, with contemporary expressions, reactions and opinions. Is this irreverent? I don't believe so. Much has been made of the fact that Mary plays girls' basketball, as if this is a sacrilege.</p><p>I believe Godard put her on the team in an attempt to make her seem like an average teenager - as the completely human being that God chose to bear his son. God did, after all, create basketball and basketball players, and there are times when I suspect that he is a DePaul fan.</p><p>The professions of Joseph and Mary's father also have become controversial. But why? If Joseph could be a carpenter in the New Testament, why not a taxi driver? The point is to show him as an everyday workingman.</p><p>Most of the controversy about "Hail Mary" centers on the nudity in the film, of which there is a good deal. It is not, however, the sort of prurient and degrading nudity that one can see in dozens of hard-core porno films that play in Chicago every month. It is the sort of objective, non-sexual nudity that we might expect as a young girl questions the miracle that is happening within her body.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46hmKKkXaKus8WManBxbg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
