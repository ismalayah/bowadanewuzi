However, he also admitted it was “idiotic” and “looks terrible in context.” But as Jackson told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sunday Times</a> in an interview that ran over the weekend, he doesn’t give a rat’s ass about Rogan’s “context.”</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>“People are always calling me about doing a podcast, but I can’t talk for an hour without saying something fucked-up,” Jackson quipped, explaining why he personally refrains from the medium.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true>“He is saying nobody understood the context when he said it,” the Pulp Fiction star explained, with an apparent eye roll, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Yahoo! Entertainment</a>. “But he shouldn’t have said it. It’s not the context, dude — it’s that he was comfortable doing it. Say that you’re sorry because you want to keep your money, but you were having fun, and you say you did it because it was entertaining.”</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false>“It needs to be an element of what the story is about,” Jackson added. “A story is context — but just to elicit a laugh? That’s wrong.”</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Jackson also explained why his frequent collaborator Quentin Tarantino gets flack for using the N-word in his film, and why the comparison isn’t fair.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>“Every time someone wants an example of overuse of the N-word, they go to Quentin — it’s unfair,” Jackson continued. “He’s just telling the story and the characters do talk like that. When Steve McQueen does it, it’s art. He’s an artiste. Quentin’s just a popcorn filmmaker.”</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=false>Rogan’s racist remarks came in the midst of backlash over Spotify continuing to give the 54-year-old podcast host a platform to spew misinformation — a privilege the music streamer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">paid handsomely for</a>. In the wake of the controversy, several artists, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most notably Neil Young</a>, have begun a mass exodus of the platform as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-Spotify hashtags began trending</a>. Even weeks later, it’s clear that many folks are not ready or willing to forgive Rogan or Spotify.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9KapK6dnGK5brbAnKKsp55iu7DAjKiiZqKfmnqzu8aapWato5p6r3nWqKmdZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
