While the song's overall theme can be interpreted in various ways, it primarily explores the destructive nature of power and privilege, and the impact they have on individuals and society as a whole.One standout lyric in the song is "He won the lottery when he was born." This line serves as a metaphor for the advantages and opportunities certain individuals receive simply by virtue of their birth circumstances. It highlights the unfairness and inequality that exists in society, where some people are handed a winning ticket while others struggle to make ends meet.The lyrics also touch upon the concept of systemic racism and social injustice. The line "Big hand slapped the white male American" suggests that society favors and protects those who fit into the dominant group, in this case, white males. It sheds light on the privilege that comes with being part of the majority, while others are caught in a web of discrimination and prejudice.Another powerful phrase in the song is "Dirty his hands, it comes right off." This lyric speaks to the ability of those in positions of power to wash away their transgressions effortlessly. It highlights the stark contrast between the consequences faced by the marginalized and the untouchability of the privileged. The idea that one's status can absolve them of responsibility or accountability is deeply unsettling.The repeated mention of the police in the lyrics plays a significant role in foregrounding issues of racial profiling and police brutality. The line "Police stopped my brother again" reflects the ongoing cycle of injustice faced by marginalized communities, where individuals are continuously targeted and harassed based on their race or ethnicity. This theme ties into the overarching concept of abuse of power and systemic oppression.In a twist of irony, the lyric "Jesus greets me, looks just like me" introduces a religious undertone to the song. It suggests that even in a society that claims to advocate for justice and equality, individuals are often blind to their own flaws and prejudices, even when faced with a figure who epitomizes compassion and understanding.The song ends with repeated chants of "Hey now, hold on." These lyrics convey a call to action, urging listeners to recognize and confront the injustices present in society. It serves as a reminder that change begins with acknowledging the issues and taking a stand against them, rather than turning a blind eye to the struggles faced by others.Overall, "W.M.A." is a poignant and socially conscious song that tackles themes of power, privilege, systemic oppression, and societal injustices. Through its vivid and imaginative lyrics, it invites listeners to reflect on the implications of unchecked power and the importance of advocating for a fairer and more inclusive society.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyxscCro2aikaJ8rrHAp6Cnn12ks27DjKZkmmWSrnqxscCro2aikaI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
