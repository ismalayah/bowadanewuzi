But you can hurry and check out the Instagram story <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> before it disappears forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot-2022-06-30-at-17.03.04.png><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>Page was previously married to choreographer Emma Portner, who he met on Instagram, but the couple divorced in 2021. Little is known of Page’s love life since.</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>Page made history in March / April of 2021, becoming the first transgender male to appear on the cover of Time magazine. In the featured article, Page described himself as&nbsp;queer&nbsp;and non-binary. Before that, on Feb. 14, 2014, Page — who at that time presented as female — came out&nbsp;as gay during a speech at the&nbsp;Human Rights Campaign’s “Time to Thrive” conference in&nbsp;Las Vegas. Therefore, we can only rightly assume that Page is attracted to women, but his sexuality remains undisclosed following his transition.</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>Page has become an inspiration for countless transgender, non-binary and queer individuals all across the globe. It’s only fair that he finds some happiness and closure for himself. Best of luck to you, Elliot Page. And best of luck to you too, hopeful singletons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8Slo6KnpGK9orPEZqGuq6RiwKqzzZ6bZq2gYrOwvoyhoKxllp6%2FtMCMnZitoZ6ceqK8z2aqqGWSmsC1ec6fZKWtk6B6tbuMsqauZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
