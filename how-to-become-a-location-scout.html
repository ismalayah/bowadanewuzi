They use Google, browse <a href=#>Peerspace</a>, and look into real estate. Plus, they are ready to stop while driving if they spot an exciting place.</p><p>Even without assignments, location scouts are actively searching for locations. If they see one, they rely on photos, videos, and dutiful note-taking to commemorate a possible new addition to their locations database.</p><p>This requires a lot of physical visits to potential shoot sites before the film begins production. Scouts are looking to see what kind of access a location allows for a large crew of people to come and inhabit along with truckloads of gear. Location scouts make sure there’s parking and note what nearby streets might need to shut down. They may also create a list of <a href=#>hotels</a> and <a href=#>restaurants</a> where the cast and crew can stay and eat.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What a location scout must consider</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/los-angeles-ranch-cabin-1024x683.jpeg><p>A location might appear perfect to the naked eye. Still, upon closer inspection and understanding of film production, a scout might note that on-site construction work is audible for miles, which won’t work if the means aren’t available to shut down that construction site for the weeks needed.</p><p>Perhaps the lighting is too dim, and there is no electricity running to that abandoned building. Or maybe the location owner doesn’t allow the alteration of their property, even though the production designer and the director want to paint the walls a bright red. A location scout considers everything; they act as the eyes and ears of the entire film crew.</p><p>They have to consider street traffic and foot traffic as well. And at every step of the way, they consult with the property owners as well as the production crew. It goes to show how crucial skills like attention t detail, excellent communication, and problem-solving are in this line of work.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How do you become a location scout?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/1938-Charming-Renovated-Bungalow-perfect-for-Video-Photo-Shoots-atlanta-rental-1024x683.jpg><p>Because they are the eyes and ears of the crew, a good location scout has to know about lighting and cinematography. Like most jobs in the film industry, there is no blatant education requirement, but many go to film school to learn about production.</p><p>A background in management is essential, and many have experience as an associate producer or line producer. Because of all the legal matters involved with location scouting, a familiarity with insurance, contracts, and liability issues is a plus. Location scouts rely on a solid network of people cultivated from their time in the industry. This network includes other scouts, filmmakers, film commissions, local government, and locals from different neighborhoods.</p><p>Therefore, it is crucial for a location scout to be communicative and have strong interpersonal skills. Scouts are creative but realistic types who are quick to solve problems that might arise on a set. They are great at multitasking because they have to work long hours and juggle multiple location negotiations at once.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The hierarchy of becoming a location scout</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/South-Lake-Union-Penthouse-with-Lake-Union-View-seattle-rental-1-1024x692.jpg><p>Location scouts begin their careers working from the bottom and climbing to the top. So when asking how to become a location scout, there isn’t one specific way. They start humbly as production assistants on sets, learning from everyone around them and starting their network of connections.</p><p>There are also positions as location production assistants, which help prep or wrap locations, so they are often not on an active set. A step above that is a location assistant. This person is on set before, during, and after a shoot. They keep the space clean, locals happy, and assist with anything location-related. While this position is often only found in big productions, it still can require a team of one to three people.</p><p>A location manager is also usually used on bigger productions to oversee the locations department, including the location scout. They are in charge of giving the final say on locations, and they manage the location budget. They are rarely on set, but sometimes they will do physical scouting work.</p><p>So most location scouts may begin their career as production assistants, then work their way up to the role of location production assistant. If so desired, a location scout may advance their career and become a location manager. It all depends on what aspects of these jobs appeal to you most.</p><p><strong>Here’s <a href=#>where to find a location scout in Los Angeles</a> for all your production needs!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbHEq6qpmZOae6S7zGipnqufqr%2BksdJon6ivXam8bq7EnKamnV2Weq27wpqroqeeYsCku9StZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
